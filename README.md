# Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using linear and tree-based regression models
Analysis of a dataset that contains the estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada in 2022. There are 946 vehicles. The attributes are the model year, the make, the model, the vehicle class, the engine size (L), the number of cylinders, the transmission, the fuel type, the fuel consumption in city (L/100 km), the fuel consumption in highway (L/100 km), the combined fuel consumption (L/100 km), the combined fuel consumption (mpg), the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (g/km), a CO<sub>2</sub> rating and a smog rating. The aim is to predict the amount of grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometer that a vehicle emits based on various technical characteristics. After analyzing the variables, linear and tree-based regression models will be proposed. We will train them, evaluate the results and prepare them to make new predictions.

The code is in the notebook *co2emissions-code.ipynb* and the dataset is in *MY2022 Fuel Consumption Ratings.csv*.

This analysis is for vehicles in 2022, but information for other years can be found at https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata
